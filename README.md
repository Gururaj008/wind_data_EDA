 Renewable energy plays a crucial role in addressing the urgent challenges of climate change, energy security, and sustainable development. Its importance stems from several key factors. Firstly, renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal power generate electricity without relying on finite fossil fuel resources, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating the harmful effects of climate change. This transition to renewables is essential for achieving global climate goals and limiting global temperature rise. Secondly, renewable energy enhances energy security by diversifying the energy mix and reducing dependence on imported fuels, fostering self-sufficiency and resilience. Additionally, the decentralized nature of renewable energy systems empowers communities and promotes local economic development, creating jobs and stimulating innovation. Furthermore, renewable energy helps address social and environmental concerns by improving air quality, reducing pollution-related health risks, and protecting ecosystems. By transitioning to renewable energy, we can foster a sustainable, low-carbon future that ensures a cleaner, healthier, and more prosperous world for current and future generations.
 
Wind energy holds significant significance as a renewable energy source due to its abundance, scalability, and environmental benefits. Harnessing the power of wind through wind turbines allows for the generation of clean and sustainable electricity without producing greenhouse gas emissions or air pollutants. The scalability of wind power enables large-scale installations, both onshore and offshore, contributing to the global energy transition. Wind energy offers a reliable and predictable power source, reducing dependence on fossil fuels and enhancing energy security. Furthermore, wind farms can stimulate local economies by creating jobs, attracting investments, and providing lease income to landowners. As a renewable resource, wind energy plays a vital role in reducing carbon emissions, mitigating climate change, and fostering a sustainable future for generations to come.

Wind energy is of great importance in India, with an installed capacity of 42633 MW (March 2023) of Wind Energy, Renewable Energy Sources (excluding large Hydro) currently accounts for 30.08% (125160 MW) of India\’s overall installed power capacity of 416059 MW (31.03.2023). Wind Energy holds the major portion of 34.06% of total RE capacity among renewable and continued as the major supplier of clean energy. The Government of India has fixed a target of 500 GW of Renewable Energy by 2030 out of which 140 GW will be from Wind. The Wind Potential in India was first estimated by National Institute of Wind Energy (NIWE) at 50m hub-height i.e. 49 GW but according to the survey at 80m hub height, the potential grows as much as 102 GW and 302GW at 100 Meter hub height. Further a new study by NIWE at 120m height has estimated a potential 695GW. One of the major advantages of wind energy is its inherent strength to support rural employment and uplift of rural economy. Further, unlike all other sources of power, wind energy does not consume any water- which in itself will become a scarce commodity. Overall the future of Wind Energy in India is bright as energy security and self-sufficiency is identified as the major driver. The biggest advantage with wind energy is that the fuel is free, and also it doesn’t produce CO2 emission. Wind farm can be built reasonably fast, the wind farm land can be used for farming as well thus serving dual purpose, and it is cost-effective as compare to other forms of renewable energy.

EDA stands for Exploratory Data Analysis. It is a process of analyzing and summarizing data to gain insights, identify patterns, and uncover relationships in a concise and intuitive manner. EDA involves various statistical and visual techniques to explore data sets, understand their underlying structure, and make informed decisions. By using EDA, researchers, analysts, and data scientists can uncover hidden patterns, detect anomalies, validate assumptions, and guide the development of further analysis or modelling. It is an essential step in the data analysis pipeline, providing a foundation for understanding data before diving into more complex analyses or machine learning algorithms.
The main objective of this project is to ascertain the effect of pertaining weather conditions on wind speed. The effects vary with time and hence call for seasonal, monthly, daily and hourly analysis which is exactly what I have tried to achieve here. The dataset comprises of wind data (Datetime, Wind direction, Wind speed, Temperature, Solar irradiation, Relative humidity, Pressure ) for the location of Chitradurga, India. The dataset is taken from SODA MERRA-2 website, in which one datapoint is recorded for every 10 minute from 2002-2022 accounting for a total of 1048551 data points for the entire period.

Karnataka has the following four seasons in the year: The winter season from January to February, The summer season from March to May, The monsoon season from June to September, The post-monsoon season from October to December. Hence, created a separate dataset for each season. For monthly analysis, created separate datasets for all 12 months for 20 years and for daily and hourly analysis used filtering on monthly datasets.
I intentionally didnt try to provide any description for the plots as the plots speak for themselves.

Finally,i would like to thank https://www.soda-pro.com/ for providing access to their dataset which made this research activity possible.
